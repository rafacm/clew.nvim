### Added

- `clew` command-line tool with three subcommands: `index` (discover units,
  index each, merge into one index), `units` (list discoverable build roots and
  the indexer chosen for each), and `lsp` (serve the index on stdio).
- SCIP index merge that folds per-unit indexes into one: single normalised
  metadata, per-unit `relative_path` prefixing, document-scoped `local` symbols,
  and `external_symbols` deduplication.
- SCIP query layer handling all three occurrence range encodings
  (`single_line_range`, `multi_line_range`, and the deprecated packed `range`).
- Unit discovery by build root (`pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `package.json` +
  `tsconfig`/`angular.json`), so single repositories, git superprojects and
  monorepos are all handled by one code path.
- Maven/Java indexing that runs without executing the project build and without
  modifying `pom.xml`, including the `javacopts.txt` step required for Maven
  coordinate stamping.
- TypeScript/JavaScript indexing via `scip-typescript`.
- stdio language server backed by a loaded SCIP index, serving
  `textDocument/definition`, `textDocument/references`,
  `textDocument/documentSymbol` and `workspace/symbol`, with no third-party LSP
  library.
- Neovim plugin (`lua/clew`, `plugin/clew.lua`) that registers the server via
  `vim.lsp.config`/`vim.lsp.enable`, with `:ClewIndex`, `:ClewStatus`,
  `:ClewRestart` and `:checkhealth clew`.
- Outermost-root detection, so a git superproject yields one server rather than
  one per submodule, with `.clew/config.toml` as an explicit override.
- Documentation: `README.md`, `doc/clew.txt` vim help, and `NOTES.md` recording
  what is verified versus unbuilt.
- Project logo and MIT `LICENSE`.
